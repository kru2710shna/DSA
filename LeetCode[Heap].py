# Problem: #973. K Closest Points to Origin
# 
# Level - Medium
# 
# Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
# 
# The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
# 
# You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
# Output: [[-2,2]]
# Explanation:
# The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
# The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
# Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
# We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
# 
# Example 2:
# Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
# Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
# Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

# Problem: #215. Kth Largest Element in an Array
# 
# Level - Medium
# 
# Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.
# Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
# Can you solve it without sorting?

# Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
# Output: 5

# Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
